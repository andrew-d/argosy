# Argosy

## What is Argosy?

This is a side-project of mine that I've been meaning to write for a while.  In short, it's a Backbone.js webapp that helps you organize, tag, and search through all your media files.

NOTE: This is currently in development.  Chances are, it won't actually do anything useful for you.

## What does "Argosy" mean?

The name 'argosy' is from one of the more obscure definitions of the word in English, meaning: "A collection of lore".
